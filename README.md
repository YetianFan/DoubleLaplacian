# DoubleLaplacian

These files are designed for deep neural networks with the double laplacian matrix. 
The title of paper is " Enhancing the Hidden Structure of Deep Neural Networks through Double Laplacian Regularization".
The codes of fully connected neural networks  are written in Matlab, and that of convolutional neural networks in Python.
